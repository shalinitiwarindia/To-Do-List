# To-Do List Web Application

## Description  
This is a simple **To-Do List** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application allows users to add items to a list with details like the item name, quantity, and priority. Submitted tasks are dynamically displayed in a table for better organization and tracking.

---

## Features  
- **Add Items**: Users can input item details including name, quantity, and priority.  
- **Dynamic Table**: Items are dynamically rendered in a table format upon form submission.  
- **Priority Selection**: Select from three levels of priority (High, Medium, Low).  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive UI for ease of use.  

---

## How It Works  
1. Users enter the **item name** and **quantity** in the form fields.  
2. Select the desired **priority** from the dropdown menu.  
3. On clicking the submit button, the item is added to the table displayed below the form.  

The application utilizes JavaScript's DOM manipulation to update the table dynamically without refreshing the page.

---

## Code Highlights  
- **HTML Structure**:  
  - A form with input fields and a dropdown for item details.  
  - A table to display the added items in a structured format.  

- **CSS Styling**:  
  - Simple and clean styles for better readability and UI aesthetics.  

- **JavaScript Functionality**:  
  - `todoList()` function handles form submission, extracts input values, and appends new rows to the table dynamically.  
  - Prevents default form submission behavior using `event.preventDefault()`.

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.  
3. Enter item details in the form, select priority, and click "Submit".  
4. View the added items in the table below the form.

---

## Future Enhancements  
- **Edit/Delete Functionality**: Allow users to modify or remove items from the list.  
- **Persistence**: Save tasks using localStorage to retain data across page reloads.  
- **Responsive Design**: Enhance the layout for better usability on mobile devices.
